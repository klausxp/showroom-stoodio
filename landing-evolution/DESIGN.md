# Design System: Luxury Editorial Minimalism

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
**Aesthetic:** Exaggerated Minimalism / Luxury Editorial.
**Mood:** Sophisticated, airy, premium, and confident. Large whitespace, high contrast, and refined typography.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Primary Black (#000000):** Used for headlines and primary text to ensure maximum contrast.
- **Pure White (#FFFFFF):** The canvas. Used to create a sense of space and focus.
- **Subtle Silver (#F5F5F7):** Used for background sections and secondary containers.
- **Accent Gold (#C5A059):** Used sparingly for interactive micro-elements or highlights.

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Display Header:** Playfair Display (Serif) - Medium weight, generous letter spacing. Used for large, impactful headlines.
- **Body Text:** Inter (Sans-serif) - Light/Regular weight. Crisp, readable, and modern.

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Sharp, squared-off edges (#000000 background with #FFFFFF text). Hover effect: subtle transparency or Gold border.
* **Cards:** Flat design, no shadows or very whisper-soft diffused shadows. Generous internal padding.
* **Images:** Full-bleed or framed with wide white margins. Portfolio items should use high-quality imagery.

## 5. Layout Principles
- **Grid:** Asymmetric layout options to break the "template" feel. 
- **Whitespace:** Prioritize "negative space" to let content breathe.
- **Responsiveness:** Fluid transitions between desktop and mobile.
